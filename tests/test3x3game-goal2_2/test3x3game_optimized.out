********************** NUSMV GAME GRID CONTROLLER SYNTHESIS ***********************


Number of line N: 3
Number of column M: 3
Goal of the grid: (2, 2)


Grid value 0: grid cell without obstacle (traversable cell).
Grid value 1: grid cell with obstacle.
Grid value 2: controlled grid cell.
Grid value G: goal cell.
